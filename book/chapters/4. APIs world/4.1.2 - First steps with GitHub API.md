### 4.1.2 First steps with GitHub API  
Usually APIs have a good documentation that explain how it works, so it’s very recommended read it before start to write the first line of code and understand what things you can to do with it.  
  
In our case, we’ll use GitHub API, so on first place we need to go to [http://developer.github.com/](http://developer.github.com/) where we can found several pages about all the things that you are allowed to do.  
  
Our application will show user’s repositories and their friends, so we need to pay special attention to user’s section ([http://developer.github.com/v3/users/](http://developer.github.com/v3/users/)), because we’ll use these queries:  
  
* `users/%@/repos`  
* `users/%@/followers`  
* `users/%@/following`  
  
You can test what returns each url for understand better this chapter, for example, you could want to see my repositories, so you could open in your favorite browser this URL:[https://api.github.com/users/patoroco/repos](https://api.github.com/users/patoroco/repos).  
  
As you saw, the answer is returned in JSON format, so it’s easy of read each part on it, and understand what field is from the key name.  
  
Once we have understand how API’s runs, we going to create the skeleton of the app where show interesting information.
