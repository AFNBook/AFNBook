### 4.2.4 Instagram API Client  
  
As we did on first part of this chapter, we need to subclass `AFHTTPClient` to configure all our requests from now. Procedure is almost the same that in the first part, changing URL to requests to [https://api.instagram.com/v1/](https://api.instagram.com/v1/), but the novelty is that we need to add token on all requests, so we going to override getPath implementation as follows:  
  
```obj-c  
-(void)getPath:(NSString *)path parameters:(NSDictionary *)parameters  
	success:(void (^)(AFHTTPRequestOperation *, id))success  
	failure:(void (^)(AFHTTPRequestOperation *, NSError *))failure{  
  
	NSMutableDictionary *param = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];  
  
	JMAppDelegate *delegate = [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];  
  
	if (delegate.token)  
		[param setValue:delegate.token forKey:@"access_token"];  
  
	[super getPath:path parameters:param success:success failure:failure];  
}   
```  
  
From now, all getPath requests will be authenticated by default, so we can start to shoot screens!
