### 4.1.1 But… What the hell is an API?  
Maybe I should have started here. API is acronym of *Application Programming Interface* and in summary is a “language” provided by a specific service to communicate with, and allows for example to do requests about users, likes or whatever which has been implemented by the API service.  
  
A lot of APIs are available on Internet to get their information without to be login on these platforms. A good illustration is Twitter API, where it’s possible to make a query and it retrieves a list of twits that include a specific word, for example to follow an event.  
  
Also it’s possible to do things related with your personal account, as write a twit, but for this you need to be logged, and we’ll explain it in the last section of this chapter.
