# 4. API’s world  
In chapter 3 we learned how to read a structured file from Internet and use information contents on it to fill our application. Ok, that’s right, but you need to create these files and put in yourself server. What would you think if I tell you that you can catch a lot information from your favourite social network without too effort? On this chapter we’ll learn how to develop an application that is filled with data from services from Internet alien to us.  
  
On the first part of the chapter you’ll consume *free information*, without need of introduce any user or password, on this case from GitHub.  
  
Second part of the chapter is about OAuth, an open login protocol that allows you to get information related with your specific user; in this case we’ll use Instagram API to load friend list and their photos.  
  
The main point that I would like to emphasize along this chapter is that all these information is out there, and you can get and represent it, as you like to make your application over these APIs.
