## 4.2 Authenticated APIs  
First part of this chapter explained how to consume a public API, but sometimes you need to be logged to ask to this API specific information, for example what messages you have on your Facebook inbox or your last checking on Foursquare.  
  
Login could be one of the most difficult things to do on API management, but fortunately time ago appears some standards protocols to this purpose, one of these is OAuth that has different versions.  
  
On this second part of this chapter, we’ll create a mini client for Instagram social network, where we’ll see a list of our friends and inside of each one, a list of their photos with filter names.
