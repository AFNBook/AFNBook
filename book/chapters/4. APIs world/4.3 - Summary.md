## 4.3 Summary  
In this chapter we learned how to consume a public API (GitHub) and we have seen all possibilities that gives as developers: you can enrich your application using information of different services.  
  
Sometimes it’s necessary to be logged in these services (social networks for example), so on second part of the chapter we saw how to log in from our application to Instagram and do things relative to this user, for example see a list of friend photos.  
  
In the next chapter we will fight with these pages, which don’t provide us a public API, so we need to scraping the content.
