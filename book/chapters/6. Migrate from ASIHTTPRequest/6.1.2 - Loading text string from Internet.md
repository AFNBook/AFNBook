### 6.1.2 Loading text string from Internet  
  
As we did at chapter two, we going to repeat our particular *"Hello world"* sample, and we’ll load a simple text from Internet ([http://afnbook.herokuapp.com/date.php](http://afnbook.herokuapp.com/date.php)) to show up on a webview as in the following image.

First, we need to define `IBOutlet` to connect components with our class, so for standardize we take the following names.  
  
```obj-c  
@interface JMViewController ()  
	@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UITextField *urlField;  
	@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIWebView *webView;  
@end  
```  
  
After that, we need to define what will happen when button is pressed, that is, create a `NSURL` object with content of the textfield, and use it for make a `ASIHTTPRequest` (don’t forget to include `ASIHTTPRequest.h` in your header file) as follows.  
  
```obj-c  
- (IBAction)loadURL:(id)sender {  
	NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:self.urlField.text];  
	ASIHTTPRequest *request = [ASIHTTPRequest requestWithURL:url];  
	[request setDelegate:self];  
	[request startAsynchronous];  
}  
```  
  
With `ASIHTTPRequest` you need to choose between a synchronous or asynchronous request, because sometimes this is interesting for you, but as example we going to use asynchronous call by similar, so set self as delegate (you need to conform `ASIHTTPRequestDelegate` in your class) and finally call to `startAsynchronous` method to begin the request.  
  
`ASIHTTPRequest` has several optional methods, but at this time you only need to implement two of these: success and error. As you can remember, with AFNetworking these are two blocks inside of the same method call, but here you need to implement two different delegate methods for it as follows.  
  
```obj-c  
#pragma mark - ASIHTTPRequestDelegate  
-(void)requestFinished:(ASIHTTPRequest *)request{  
	NSString *responseString = request.responseString;  
	// if you are managing binary data, you need to use  
	// responseString = request.responseData;  
	[self.webView loadHTMLString:responseString baseURL:nil];  
}  
  
-(void)requestFailed:(ASIHTTPRequest *)request{  
    NSLog(@"ERROR: %@", request.error.localizedDescription);  
}  
```  
  
As you saw, `responseString` comes directly from the request, so it’s easy get it. If you would download an image or a binary file in general, you should use `responseData` instead it. After that, you only need to load this string in your webview and voila!  
  
In case that an error was returned, only display it in your log at this time (this shouldn’t happen ☺).
