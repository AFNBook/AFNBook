### 6.2.1 Using AFNetworking instead of ASIHTTPRequest in our project  
  
As we learned throughout this book, `AFNetworking` has an architecture based on blocks mainly, and you has seen that `ASIHTTPRequest` is based on delegate methods, so at this point maybe you are supposing how hard will be migrate it from one architecture to the other.  
  
Fortunately exists an `AFNetworking` category that facilitates this process allowing you only include this category in your header file, as we’ll explain, so first of all we going to download it from [https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking-ASIHTTPRequest](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking-ASIHTTPRequest) and copy in our project the following files:  
  
* `AFHTTPRequestOperation+ASIHTTPRequest.h`  
* `AFHTTPRequestOperation+ASIHTTPRequest.m`  
  
At this moment we have category in our project, but don’t have `AFNetworking`, so remembering what we have learned in previous chapters, close XCode and edit a Podfile file as follows.  
  
```obj-c  
platform :ios, '6.0'  
pod 'AFNetworking', '1.0'  
```  
  
Now run `pod install` and open `xcworkspace` instead of `xcproject`, and include `AFHTTPRequestOperation+ASIHTTPRequest.h` in viewcontroller’s header.  
  
What else? Nothing! Yea, `AFNetworking` category do these work by you, so you are free to make performance tests at this point because you are using `AFNetworking`.
