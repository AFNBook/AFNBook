## 6.3 Summary  
  
On this chapter we discovered a library to manage network requests, which was very used by developers before AFNetworking appeared, but what raised a problem when was deprecated.  
  
Fortunately, an AFNetworking category was developed to make a direct migration without rewriting our legacy code, allowing us to change from delegate architecture to block architecture, which is used by AFNetworking.  
  
On the next chapter weâ€™ll discover some projects born around AFNetworking, creating a big ecosystem which facilitates some typical tasks as make an OAuth authentication or parse CSV files between others.
