### 6.2.2 Understanding how AFNetworking category runs  
  
As last part of this chapter we want that you understand how this category works, and for this we invite you to open header file where youâ€™ll see the following line.  
  
```obj-c  
@compatibility_alias ASIHTTPRequest AFHTTPRequestOperation;  
```  
  
This keyword tell to compiler that when it read a `ASIHTTPRequest`, replace it by `AFHTTPRequestOperation` (you can find more info about this keyword on GNU compiler, [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/compatibility_005falias.html](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/compatibility_005falias.html)), so this saves you from requirement to rename all classes and methods calls.
