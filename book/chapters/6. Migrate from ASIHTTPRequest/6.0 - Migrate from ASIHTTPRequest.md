# 6 Migrate from ASIHTTPRequest  
  
In chapter 2 we showed how difficult is to manage several request at the same time using SDK included classes (`NSURLRequest`, `NSOperation`, etc.), because that some libraries started to grow up trying to encapsulate this task and facilitate developer’s work when he need to fight with complicated APIs for example.  
  
One of the most popular libraries was `ASIHTTPRequest`, created by Ben Copsey (*@pokeb*), which has been starred almost 4.500 times on Github, demonstrating that was very followed by developers who included it in their iOS projects.  
  
Problems came when his author decided don’t continue with his development and improvement, so several libraries born trying to continue his legacy, and as you can think now, AFNetworking was one of the winners on this combat to popularity. Developers who loved `ASIHTTPRequest` had a difficult decision in front of there: continue using a deprecated library or migrate to the new and improved `AFNetworking`.  
  
To help on this change it was created another library (truly a category of `AFNetworking`), named `AFNetworking-ASIHTTPRequest`, that as you are thinking allows you to use AFNetworking in an old ASI-project without take care about nothing.  
  
This chapter will show you how worked `ASIHTTPRequest`, and how to make a first migration to AFNetworking in only some minutes.
