## 3.2.2. Fetching themes from Internet
We hung two different themes to use in your application:  

* black theme ([http://afnbook.herokuapp.com/theme_black.plist](http://afnbook.herokuapp.com/theme_black.plist))
* white theme ([http://afnbook.herokuapp.com/theme_white.plist](http://afnbook.herokuapp.com/theme_white.plist))  

If you download one of these files you’ll see a structure like the following:  
  
```xml  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">    
<plist version="1.0">  
<dict>  
	<key>background</key>  
	<dict>  
		<key>color</key>  
		<string>#000000</string>  
	</dict>  
	<key>buttons</key>  
	<dict>  
		<key>background_color</key>  
		<string>#FFFFFF</string>  
		<key>font</key>  
		<dict>  
			<key>color</key>  
			<string>#0000FF</string>  
			<key>family</key>  
			<string>Helvetica-Bold</string>  
			<key>size</key>  
			<integer>20</integer>  
		</dict>  
	</dict>  
	<key>textview</key>  
	<dict>  
		<key>font</key>  
		<dict>  
			<key>color</key>  
			<string>#FFFFFF</string>  
			<key>size</key>    
			<integer>18</integer>  
			<key>family</key>    
			<string>Helvetica-Light</string>    
		</dict>    
	</dict>    
</dict>    
</plist>    
```

As you can see, appear three big groups (background, buttons and textview), each one with their properties. These will be used to change appearance of our app.  

First of all, we need to download file from Internet, in these case we’ll use AFPropertyListRequestOperation class that retrieve us a NSDictionary with content of the file. Because we’ll load different theme files, is advisable to create a method that help us in download tasks as you can see below:  

```obj-c  
-(void)loadThemeURL:(NSString *)urlString{  
NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:urlString];  NSURLRequest *request = [[NSURLRequest alloc] initWithURL:url];  
AFPropertyListRequestOperation *properties = [AFPropertyListRequestOperation  
	propertyListRequestOperationWithRequest:request  
	success:^(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, id propertyList) {  
		[self updateViewWithTheme:(NSDictionary *)propertyList];  
	} failure:^(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, NSError *error, id propertyList) {  
		NSLog(@"ERROR: %@\n%@", error.localizedDescription, propertyList);  
	}];  
[properties start];  
}  
```  

Sure that the first two lines are familiar to you, because you used in last chapter in the same way. Third line use a subclass of  `AFHTTPRequestOperation` that will execute a block when success or another when fail. After that, call to start operation method.  

Success block includes request and response parameters, besides a propertyList that should be an NSDictionary which contains all the property list using key value model.In this case, we create also another method which will update the view using these values as is shown in next subsection.
