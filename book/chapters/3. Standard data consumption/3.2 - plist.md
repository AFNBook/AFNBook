## 3.2. .plist
This kind of file is popular because is one of the easiest ways to persist data when you develop an application.  

Basically is a subset of XML files which uses a `DTD` (Document Type Definition) defined by Apple (you can see this definition on [http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd](http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd)) which include the most popular data types (string, number, array, object) and provides help when you need to manage the data included in, turning file in a **NSDictionary** that is easy to handle by programmer. In the same way, it’s easy to convert a NSDictionary to a `.plist` file, but that’s out of scope of the book.  

For understand the utility of `.plist` files and how treat with it using AFNetworking, we’ll go to develop an application that changes their appearance depending content of a property list file downloaded from Internet.
