## 3.1. Loading structured data in our app
As first part of this chapter, weâ€™ll learn how to use structured data loaded from Internet in our applications. This will be done using three different helpers that AFNetworking provides, one by each kind of file:  

* Property list files (**.plist**).
* JavaScript Object Notation (**JSON**).
* Extensible Markup Language (**XML**).  

All knowledge explained here will be used in next chapter to consume different public APIs, so please pay attention.
