## 3.6. Summary  

Here we’ve learned how to manage different structured data, from simplest property list to a complex XML, passing through thin JSON which is very popular between today’s APIs.  

As final gift, we used UIImageView category included in AFNetworking framework and helps in hard task of download and manage load image in UIImageViews, doing that asynchronously without having us to worry about anything.  

On the next chapter, we’ll employ these knowledge to consume a real world API and understand the amount of applications that we can make from these.
