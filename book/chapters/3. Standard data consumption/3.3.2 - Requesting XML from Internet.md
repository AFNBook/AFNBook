### 3.3.2. Requesting XML from Internet  

As at other times, first step is to download file from Internet and manage it. In this case, we’ll use `AFXMLRequestOperation` class, and method will be executed when button is pressed, so we’ll create an IBAction for that as follows:  
  
```obj-c  
NSString * const sampleXML = @"http://afnbook.herokuapp.com/provincias.xml";  

- (IBAction)readXML {  
    NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:sampleXML];  
    NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url];  
    AFXMLRequestOperation *operation = [AFXMLRequestOperation  
		XMLParserRequestOperationWithRequest:request  
		success:^(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, NSXMLParser *XMLParser) {  
			XMLParser.delegate = self;  
			[XMLParser parse];  
	} failure:nil];  

	[operation start];  
}  
```  
  
In this case, success block retrieves a `NSXMLParser` instead a `NSDictionary` as before. We need to set delegate to this parser, and after that say to it that start parse process. This is a little more complicated to manage, so pay attention at this part!  
    
 > NSXMLParser uses SAX as parser. Maybe this is a good time to learn how a parser runs, you have more info about SAX on Wikipedia [http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML).
