## 1.4. Installing with Cocoa Pods

Cocoa Pods is a library managed for XCode, like an `apt-get` for installing libraries from command line. You can find more info on their website: [http://cocoapods.org/](http://cocoapods.org/).

### 1.4.1. Installing Cocoa Pods gem
Cocoa Pods is distributed as Ruby gem, so to install it, open a Terminal and write:

```bash
sudo gem install  
pod setup
```

Once installed you can execute several commands from command-line, more info about that on the following website: [http://cocoapods.org/](http://cocoapods.org/).



### 1.4.2. Adding AFNetworking to the project
Each project that uses Cocoa Pods needs to create a *Podfile* file with specifications about packages used in the project. In our case we’ll create a Podfile (using *vim* editor for example) with the following content:

```
platform :ios, '6.0'  
pod 'AFNetworking', '1.0'
```
From this moment, you change from open *&lt;your_project&gt;.xcodeproj* file to *&lt;your_project&gt;.xcworkspace*, and you’ll see that a project named Pods was included on this workspace which does all the magic: you can forget to download manually third party libraries, Cocoa Pods will do this for you!

 > It’s necessary to include iOS version > 4.3 because AFN doesn’t support lower versions.
