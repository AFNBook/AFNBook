## 2.4. Summary
On this chapter you have learned how to make simple requests to get a text file from Internet and display its contents in a webview.  

We have started with *NSURLConnection* which is included on basic iOS SDK, and we did it in two different ways: using delegates and using blocks. These methods run correctly, but when your application starts to grow up, is very difficult to maintain, and here comes *AFNetworking* to help us.  

Final part of the chapter shows how easy is to read text file using AFNetworking, and this is just the beginning, because when *AFNetworking* starts to be very powerful is when you have several connections in different classes and you don’t need to worry about queues, operations, etc.  

In the next chapter we’ll learn how to manage some file types, as **plist**, **XML** and **JSON** to get information to configure or display in our application. We also see an awesome *UIImageView* category that helps us to forget the uncomfortable task of handling the loading of images asynchronously with cache if you need.
