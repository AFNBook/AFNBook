### 2.2.2. NSURLConnection Block
The second way that we’ll learn to deal with *NSURLConnection* is using blocks. For me, that’s less ‘magical’ than using delegates, but continues doing hard when you need manage more than only one request. Anyway, you need to know the hard form to understand the true value to have a good framework that does all the work for us, as we’ll see soon.  

The first thing that we need to do is add a queue to our controller, where we’ll send all request and will be managed in background, so add to your interface as follows.  
  
```obj-c  
@interface JMViewController ()    
    @property (strong, nonatomic) NSOperationQueue *queue;    
end  
```

We also need to initialize that queue, so *viewDidLoad* is a good place for this task. We can also use this method to set the text for our textfield with a fixed URL as follows.  

```obj-c
- (void)viewDidLoad{
    self.queue = [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init];
    self.urlField.text = sampleURL;  
    [super viewDidLoad];  
}  
```  
On this occasion, we’ll make an asynchronous request and specify what happens when it will be finished, this is calling to *sendAsynchronousRequest* method in *NSURLConnection* class.  

It’s important to take care about errors, because we must to handle them. Usually it’s done with a simple if as follows.  

```obj-c  
- (IBAction)requestWithNSURLConnectionBlock:(id)sender {  
  
NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:self.urlField.text];  
NSURLRequest *req = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url];  
  
[NSURLConnection sendAsynchronousRequest:req queue:self.queue  
   completionHandler:^(NSURLResponse *response, NSData *data, NSError *errorConnection) {  
  
       if (!errorConnection){    
           NSString *responseString = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:data encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];  
           [self.webView loadHTMLString:responseString baseURL:nil];    
       }else{    
           NSString *errorString = errorConnection.localizedDescription;  
           [self.webView loadHTMLString:errorString baseURL:nil];    
       }  
  
		[self.urlField resignFirstResponder];  
}];    

}
```  
One more time, you need to convert manually data received from Internet (think on it as ‘binary’ data) to your specific situation, on this case to *NSString* using UTF8 encoding. Some websites are on different encodings, so you if you detect strange characters on your final string, maybe you need to change data encoding.  
  
Finally, load these string into your webview and hide keyboard, because it could have  been showed to input URL in textfield.
