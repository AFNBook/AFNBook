# 2. First contact with AFNetworking: Read a simple web

The first program that people often use to start with any programming language is known as the *"Hello World"*, a simple program to understand how to show characters on console or create a UIView on iPhone’s screen for example.  

This book is about **AFNetworking**, a network library, so in this chapter we will make the minimal app to understand how to start using AFNetworking: reading a simple stream from Internet.  

First we would use the ‘old-style’ with SDK provided by Apple, that’s `NSURLConnection` in two different ways. After that, we’ll see how to do this easier using a framework for manage connections, in this case with AFNetworking.
