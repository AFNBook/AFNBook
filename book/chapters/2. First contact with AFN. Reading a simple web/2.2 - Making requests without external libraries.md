## 2.2. Making requests without external libraries  

Official SDK provided by Apple includes some classes to make a request, as we’ll see in this chapter. That’s ok for small requests in your application, but when you need make several queries to a server, or manage images, files, or whatever from internet, you’ll start feeling overloaded.  

Anyway, it’s good to know how things run in the backstage, so this first part of the chapter will show you to use connections almost manually, and for this you don’t need any third part library. Exist several forms to create *NSURLConnection*, but here we’ll show two of the most popular: using delegate or using blocks.
