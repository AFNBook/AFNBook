### 5.3.4 Get map position  
  
As an extra pill, we want to represent each line in a map, impossible is nothing!  
  
If you inspect one more time HTML source, you can see several JS scripts, but at last appears one which configure map view on website, and where you should see any similar to follows:  
  
```obj-c  
var myLatlng = new google.maps.LatLng("41.646089", "-4.720144");  
```  
  
We will use MapKit to show a map on our application, so we only need longitude and latitude from these line. Is for this that we need to add some lines to parse method to catch these values from HTML as you can see at code below:  
  
```obj-c  
-(void)parse:(NSString *)html line:(int)line{  
	…  
	NSArray *scripts = [document selectElements:@"script"];  
	for (Element *script in scripts){  
		NSString *scriptSource = ((Element *)script).contentsText;  
  
		if ([scriptSource rangeOfString:@"var myLatlng"].location != NSNotFound){  
			[self getCoordinates:scriptSource line:line];  
		}  
	}  
}  
```  
  
First of all, we search different scripts sections in all HTML file, and look for `var myLatlng` string, in which case we call to another method, which we implement in a few minutes.  
  
Before that, we going to create a category to help us to clean strings and a class which conforms MKAnnotation protocol to show pins on map with information about line.  
  
```obj-c  
@implementation NSString (AFNetworking)  
-(NSString *)removeString:(NSString *)str{  
	return [self stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:str withString:@""];  
}  
@end  
```  
  
This method only receives a substring that we want to remove from a string, and return this string without it.  
  
```obj-c  
@interface JMAnnotation : NSObject<MKAnnotation>  
@property (nonatomic, readonly) CLLocationCoordinate2D coordinate;  
@property (nonatomic, assign) int line;  
  
- (id) initWithCoordinate:(CLLocationCoordinate2D)coord line:(int)line;  
@end  
```  
  
JMAnnotation include a coordinate and a line number which will be show on a bubble when user press the pin. Implementation is too easy as you can see below:  
  
```obj-c  
@implementation JMAnnotation  
- (id) initWithCoordinate:(CLLocationCoordinate2D)coord line:(int)line{  
	self = [super init];  
	if (!self) return nil;  
 
	_line = line;  
	_coordinate = coord;  
 
	return self;  
}  
  
-(NSString *)title{  
	return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Line %i", self.line];  
}  
@end  
```  
  
Once we have that, we can implement method to get coordinates from javascript script, and which will create a JMAnnotation with these coordinates and add it to the map as follows:  
  
```obj-c  
-(void)getCoordinates:(NSString *)scriptSource line:(int)line{  
	NSError *error;  
	NSRegularExpression *regex = [NSRegularExpression  
		regularExpressionWithPattern:@"google.maps.LatLng(.*);"  
		options:0 error:&error];  
	if (regex != nil) {  
		NSTextCheckingResult *firstMatch = [regex firstMatchInString:scriptSource  
			options:0 range:NSMakeRange(0, [scriptSource length])];  
  
		if (firstMatch) {  
			NSRange accessTokenRange = [firstMatch rangeAtIndex:1];  
			NSString *accessToken = [scriptSource substringWithRange:accessTokenRange];  
			accessToken = [accessToken stringByReplacingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];  
  
			accessToken = [accessToken removeString:@"\""];  
			accessToken = [accessToken removeString:@"("];  
			accessToken = [accessToken removeString:@")"];  
  
			NSArray *listItems = [accessToken componentsSeparatedByString:@", "];  
			CLLocationDegrees lon = [listItems[0] floatValue];  
			CLLocationDegrees lat = [listItems[1] floatValue];  
			CLLocationCoordinate2D coordinate = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(lon, lat);  
  
			JAnnotation *annotation = [[JMAnnotation alloc] initWithCoordinate:coordinate line:line];  
			[self.map addAnnotation:annotation];  
			[self.map setCenterCoordinate:coordinate zoomLevel:15 animated:YES];  
		}  
	}  
}  
```  
  
If you are an expert of regular expressions, maybe you can improve this source, but I prefer to do this simple to help understanding. Instead, if you are a newbie of that, maybe this code scary you, but take your time to analyze it and you’ll see that this is very long, but bit complicated: only search by a `google.maps.LatLng(<whatever>);` string, and when found it, clean values in to use it on `JMAnnotation` object.  
  
After that, add annotation to the map and center the map using MKMapView category which will zoom animatedly to this point.
