## 5.4 Summary  
  
This chapter should serve as base to create several applications reusing information available on different websites.  
  
We’ve learned how to do that across an example with a bus company which publishes their bus stop arrivals on his website, but access to this information from an iPhone with his small screen is too difficult, so we’ve created an application that catch these information and show on more clearly.  
  
Now think about how much possibilities enables that knowledge, because you can mix information of several websites with public APIs and create a very complete application without need of develop yourself backend.  
  
On the next chapter we’ll learn about migrate from an old library similar to AFNetworking which was very used also, but that was deprecated months ago.
