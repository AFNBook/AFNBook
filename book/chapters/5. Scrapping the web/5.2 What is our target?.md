## 5.2 What is our target?  
  
Some bus companies have screens on bus stops to show how long until the next bus arrives, would not it be interesting to check this time from your house instead on wait on bus stop? Fortunately some companies publish these times on their websites, so go ahead and make an application to help users in their life!  
  
In this case we’ll use AUVASA (Valladolid, Spain) webpage to get time information, but I invite you to do the same with your city company and share with us!  
  
Ok, go with your browser to [http://www.auvasa.es/](http://www.auvasa.es/), and you can see a form on the middle of the page to enter a line number, for example 871.  
  
When you hit enter, you will be redirect to [http://www.auvasa.es/parada.asp?codigo=871](http://www.auvasa.es/parada.asp?codigo=871), you can see that URL is of the form [http://www.auvasa.es/parada.asp?codigo=&lt;stop_number&gt;](http://www.auvasa.es/parada.asp?codigo=&lt;stop_number&gt;), that’s important to the rest of the application, so we’ll define URL as a constant after.
