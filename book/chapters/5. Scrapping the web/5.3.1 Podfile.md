### 5.3.1 Podfile  
  
As is usual, we’ll use Cocoa Pods to install third party libraries, and in this case we need to include on Podfile ElementParser and MKMapViewZoom besides AFNetworking as follows:  

```yaml  
platform :ios, '6.0'  
pod 'AFNetworking', '1.0'  
pod 'ElementParser', '0.0.1'  
pod 'MKMapViewZoom', '1.0'  
```  

**ElementParser** ([http://touchtank.wordpress.com/element-parser/](http://touchtank.wordpress.com/element-parser/)) is the parser which we’ll use. I choose this one because it supports queries using CSS identifiers, and it doesn’t require a well-formed XML, so it’s perfect to parse real-world websites, because other parsers crash when XML is not perfectly formed.  
  
**MKMapViewZoom** ([http://troybrant.net/blog/2010/01/set-the-zoom-level-of-an-mkmapview/](http://troybrant.net/blog/2010/01/set-the-zoom-level-of-an-mkmapview/)) is a helper to manage zoom level similarly as Google does instead of change manually viewport region.  
  
After edit Podfile, don’t forget to execute pod install and open workspace instead of XCode project.
