# 5 Scrapping the web  
  
In the last chapter you learned how to use information of some webpages, which give you an API to consume this easily. That’s really nice, but maybe you want to use information from specific website, but it doesn’t have a public API.  
  
This chapter will explain how to catch information from any website (this technique is named *scrapping*) to use in your app, maybe to complete some services that you are paying, or simply to create a front-end for a no-mobile web which will be easy of use on a mobile device.  
  
We’ll develop an application to show how much longer are different bus lines using information that company publishes on his website, but which are difficult to understand using an iPhone for example.
