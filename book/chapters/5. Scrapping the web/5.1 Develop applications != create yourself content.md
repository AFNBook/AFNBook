## 5.1 Develop applications != create yourself content  
  
Until last chapter, you might have thought that all information showed in an application should be created and maintained by app creator, but that’s not all true.  
  
If you are familiar with blogs, you should know a standard very linked with it, named RSS (*Really Simple Syndication*), which is a subset of XML. Mainly these files can be accessed from a browser, but the main advantage of RSS is to be included in a feeds reader, where you’ll be notified when one of your favorite blogs has been updated without being visiting one by one all these favorite blogs.  
  
RSS is a good example of how you can include information from several parts in your application, and really you can do that with your current knowledge (remember that RSS is a XML file, and you can read different parts using AFNetworking subclass for XML).  
  
That’s chapter goes beyond, and we’ll try to use information contented in a real-website, reading his HTML source, which usually is not well formed from the standpoint of XML. To understand how it works, we’ll do an example of web scrapping and we’ll show information on an iOS application.
